Hermit Retro 
============

https://hermitretro.com

The changes to support the Hermit Retro products are fairly lightweight.

1) Don't print copyright to stdout when initialising
2) Add new peripheral modules for the Hermit Retro ZXZero hardware under
   peripherals/hermitretro.

   These has been implemented as a potentially reusable "GPIO membrane" 
   module, a "GPIO joystick" module, a "GPIO common" module and a high-level
   ZXZero module (which handles the Fuse menu button).
3) Don't render status info in SDL layer

GPIO Membrane
=============

This module reads the 5-way and 8-way membrane connectors via dedicated GPIO
pins and generates Fuse input events.

GPIO Joystick
=============

This module reads dedicated GPIO pins corresponding to Atari joysticks and
generates Fuse input events. The ZXZero module defaultly enables Kempston
hardware and selects that as the default Joystick 0 mapping. The joystick
type can be reassigned via the standard menus.

Buildroot
=========

The Hermit Retro machines run Raspberry Pi OS packaged with Buildroot
(https://buildroot.org) for fast startup times. Fuse and libspectrum have
had --with-buildroot configure flags added to work around hardcoded
filepath dependencies that break buildroot.
